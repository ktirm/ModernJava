/**
 * Notes from the book:
 * The AstroService class uses the gateway to access the remote web service. The
 * gateway retrieves the remote data and turns it into either a Success instance
 * containing an AstroResponse or a Failure instance containing any thrown exception
 * if not. Assuming itâ€™s successful, the service then extracts the data we want
 * and converts it to a map, where the keys are spacecraft names and the values
 * are the number of astronauts aboard each one.
